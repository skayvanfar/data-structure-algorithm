/**
 * A trie (also known as a digital tree) and sometimes even radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is an ordered tree structure, which takes advantage of the keys that it stores – usually strings.
 * <p>
 * A node's position in the tree defines the key with which that node is associated, which makes tries different in comparison to binary search trees, in which a node stores a key that corresponds only to that node.
 * <p>
 * All descendants of a node have a common prefix of a String associated with that node, whereas the root is associated with an empty String.
