A greedy algorithm is often the right choice for an optimization problem where
there's a natural set of choices to select from.
It's often easier to conceptualize a greedy algorithm recursively, and then implement it using iteration for higher performance.
Even if the greedy approach does not yield an optimum solution, it can give
insights into the optimum algorithm, or serve as a heuristic.
Sometimes the right greedy choice is not obvious.
