Be very comfortable with the bitwise operators, particularly XOR.
Understand how to use masks and create them in an machine independent way.
Know fast ways to clear the lowermost set bit (and by extension, set the lowermost
0, get its index, etc.)
Understand signedness and its implications to shifting.
Consider using a cache to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small
inputs.
Be aware that commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations
in parallel and reorder operations.
